# AUTOMATIC XEPATCHER
This project aim to make more easier the process of patching .xex file for the xbox 360 bad update exploit, 
this project require ___XePatcher___ to be putted in the directory of this program in order to start.

## How to use:
chose an ___input___ folder in the program and put only the .xex.

if want a copy of the patched and the unpatched version of the .xex, chose an __output__ directory.
### _________________________________
if you have chose an input and output,
your (for now) directory will be skipped by the programm.

### _________________________________
but if you chose only the input you can put __games folders__ (the roms) directly in the custom __input__ you chose.

### _BETA: for now you can only see the output in a python terminal when you run the programm_.
#TODO create an output of the programm

## How to run:
(for now) run the ___main.py___
